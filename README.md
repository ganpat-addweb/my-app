# ExpressJs-Best-Practices-Boilerplate

## Introduction
ExpressJs-Best-Practices-Boilerplate is a boilerplate for building ExpressJs applications with basic user CRUD and login/logout functionality. It uses the Express framework and MongoDB for database storage.


## Prerequisites
- Node.js version v20.10.0
- Git
- MongoDB
- Postman

## Installation
1. **Initialization command:**
   ```bash
   npx bootstrap-express-app my-app
   cd my-app
   ```
2. **Start Project:** </br>
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
## Documentation
### Postman Collection:
   - Find the Postman collection in the "postman collection doc" folder.
   - Import Postman collection JSON file from postman

### Swagger Documentation:
1. **Create command:**
   - After adding inline documentation comments and schemas to newly created or modified endpoint routes, run the following command to generate the Swagger documentation JSON file.
      ```bash
      npm run create-swagger-doc
      ```
   - For Inline documentation comments and schemas 
   <a href="https://swagger-autogen.github.io/docs">click here </a>

2. **Usage:**
   - For Swagger documentation, first, start the server and navigate to the '/api-docs' route. Ex. **http://localhost:3000/api-docs**

## Usage
### Development Environment:
To start the server in the local environment
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
### Production Environment: 
To start the server in the production environment
   ```bash
   npm run prod
   ```
<ul>
<li>

### Monitoring Logs: 
To watch logs in the production environment
   ```bash
   pm2 logs
   ```
</li>
<li>

### Reloading Instances: 
To reload all instances of the production environment
   ```bash
   npm run prod-reload
   ```
</li>
<li>

### Stopping Instances: 
To stop all instances of the production environment
   ```bash
   npm run prod-stop
   ```
</li>
</ul>

## Authentication Flow
   - When a user logs in with valid credentials, the server sends both an access token and a refresh token as cookies.
   - All protected routes require token validation for access.
   - If a protected route returns a status code of 401 (Unauthorized), the client needs to send a request to the '/auth/refresh_token' endpoint.
   - The '/auth/refresh_token' endpoint validates the refresh token, and if valid, generates a new pair of access and refresh tokens.
   - If the refresh token is not valid, an error response with a status code of 401 is sent, requiring the user to log in again.

## Git Best Practices

### Commit Standards

- **Atomic Commits**: Each commit should represent a single logical change. Avoid combining unrelated changes in a single commit.
  
- **Meaningful Commit Messages**: Write clear and concise commit messages that describe the purpose of the change. Follow the imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").

- **Commit Types**: Commit type must be following one:
   - feat: A new feature
   - fix: A bug fix
   - style: Changes that doesn't affect meaning of code(semi-colon, indentation, etc)
   - perf: Improve performance
   - refactor: Refactor code
   - test: Add missing test cases
   - docs: Documentation only change
   - chore: Change in auxiliary tools like documentation or seed change

- **Reference Issues**: If your commit is related to a specific issue or task, reference it in the commit message. For example, `fix: #123` or `feat: #456`. Here **#123** or **#456** are ticket Id.


### Branch Name Standards

- **Use Hyphens for Branch Names**: Use hyphens to separate words in branch names. For example, use `feature-branch` instead of `feature_branch` or `featureBranch`.

- **Prefix Branch Names**: Prefix branch names with a category or type. For example:
  - `feature/` for feature branches
  - `fix/` for fix branches
